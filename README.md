### Conditional Statements

This folder contains programs that demonstrate the use of conditional statements in Java. Conditional statements allow the program to make decisions based on specific conditions.

**Examples of Conditional Statements:**
- **If Statement**: Executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
- **If-Else Statement**: Chooses between two blocks of code based on the evaluation of a condition.
- **Else-If Ladder**: Tests multiple conditions sequentially and executes the block of code for the first true condition.
- **Switch Statement**: Selects a block of code to execute from multiple options based on a variableâ€™s value.

#### Example Programs

- **If Statement Program**: Checks if a number is positive or negative.
- **If-Else Program**: Determines if a person is eligible to vote based on age.
- **Else-If Ladder Program**: Categorizes a grade based on a numeric score.
- **Switch Statement Program**: Prints the day of the week based on an input integer.

### Access Modifiers

This folder contains programs that illustrate the use of access modifiers in Java. Access modifiers control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables.

**Examples of Access Modifiers:**
- **Public**: The field or method is accessible from any other class.
- **Private**: The field or method is accessible only within the same class.
- **Protected**: The field or method is accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
- **Default (Package-Private)**: If no access modifier is specified, the field or method is accessible only within the same package.

#### Example Programs

- **Public Modifier Program**: Demonstrates a public method accessible across packages.
- **Private Modifier Program**: Shows a private field and a public getter method.
- **Protected Modifier Program**: Illustrates protected access within a package and by subclass inheritance.
- **Default Access Modifier Program**: Demonstrates package-private access by defining methods without an access modifier.
