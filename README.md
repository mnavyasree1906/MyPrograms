### Conditional Statements

This folder contains programs that demonstrate the use of conditional statements in Java. Conditional statements allow the program to make decisions based on specific conditions.

**Examples of Conditional Statements:**
- **If Statement**: Executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
- **If-Else Statement**: Chooses between two blocks of code based on the evaluation of a condition.
- **Else-If Ladder**: Tests multiple conditions sequentially and executes the block of code for the first true condition.
- **Switch Statement**: Selects a block of code to execute from multiple options based on a variableâ€™s value.

#### Example Programs

- **If Statement Program**: Checks if a number is positive or negative.
- **If-Else Program**: Determines if a person is eligible to vote based on age.
- **Else-If Ladder Program**: Categorizes a grade based on a numeric score.
- **Switch Statement Program**: Prints the day of the week based on an input integer.

### Access Modifiers

This folder contains programs that illustrate the use of access modifiers in Java. Access modifiers control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables.

**Examples of Access Modifiers:**
- **Public**: The field or method is accessible from any other class.
- **Private**: The field or method is accessible only within the same class.
- **Protected**: The field or method is accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
- **Default (Package-Private)**: If no access modifier is specified, the field or method is accessible only within the same package.

#### Example Programs

- **Public Modifier Program**: Demonstrates a public method accessible across packages.
- **Private Modifier Program**: Shows a private field and a public getter method.
- **Protected Modifier Program**: Illustrates protected access within a package and by subclass inheritance.
- **Default Access Modifier Program**: Demonstrates package-private access by defining methods without an access modifier.

# Modifiers

This project provides a set of examples to illustrate fundamental concepts in Java programming, including access modifiers, data types, static members, string concatenation, and type casting. Each example class demonstrates a specific concept to help developers understand how these core elements function within the Java language.

### Concepts Covered

1. **Access Modifiers**  
   The examples demonstrate how different access modifiers (`public`, `protected`, `default`, and `private`) impact the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables both within the same class and across different classes.

2. **Primitive Data Types**  
   This project explores Java's primitive data types (`byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`), showcasing how they can be declared, initialized, and printed.

3. **Static Members**  
   Static members, including variables, blocks, and methods, are illustrated to show the difference between class-level (static) and instance-level behavior in Java. This includes examples of static initialization and how static methods and variables are accessed.

4. **String Concatenation**  
   The project includes examples of string concatenation, using the `+` operator to combine strings and other data types, demonstrating a common approach for creating readable output.

5. **Type Casting**  
   Examples of type casting are provided, covering both implicit (widening) and explicit (narrowing) conversions, ensuring type compatibility and control over data type conversions in Java.

Each example class is fully annotated and printed to help users follow the logic and see the results of each operation. This project serves as a useful reference for developers looking to strengthen their understanding of Java's foundational elements.
